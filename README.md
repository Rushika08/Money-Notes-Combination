# Money-Notes-Combination

Question

Money available in coins and notes. In automated teller machines (ATM), people can withdraw money from their bank accounts.
The amount of money that withdrawn from the account can be provided to the ATM user in different combinations.
For example, if a user requested LKR 1000.00, ATM can provide that in one of the following combinations:
1 x LKR1000
2 x LKR500
10 x LKR100
1 x LKR500 + 5 x LKR100
Assume, the ATM has LKR50, LKR100, LKR500, LKR1000, and LKR5000 notes and user can withdraw LKR1000 to LKR50000 in a single transaction.
The last two significant bits of the amount should be either 00 or 50 because the lowest currency note available in the ATM is LKR50.
Develop a programme to present three (03) possible combinations of notes that can satisfied users requested amount. 
One of the combinations should provide minimum number of notes.
